# Projects
 Website for Erik Schreiner's Personal Projects.
 
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Erik Schreiner. I just finished up my sophomore year at Harvard College and one of the classes I took taught me many things about fabrication, which I plan to continue.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in nanotechnology, the outdoors, and tinkering.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about mitigation of climate change, electrodeposition of FeCo alloys (for their soft magnetic properties), and babylon.js. The first two (at this time) will not be documented online. 

ðŸ“« You can reach me at erikschreiner@college.harvard.edu (any feedback/critism welcomed!)

This repository, "projects," is for my website I plan to build up with projects that I am personally working on or have completed.
